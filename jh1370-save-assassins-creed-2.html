Зику Райдеру всего десять лет. Но он невероятно талантливый и веселый не по годам. Hi, So I installed the fitgirl repack version of assassins creed origins with all DLCs. After getting back into the game there was no save file. I tried searching for the fix but I have a problem that my saves aren't created at all. I tried searching for it in Documents in CPY or Assassin's Creed - Origins folders and even the Uplay/Codex/Saves/AssassinsCreedOrigins folder in Users, but none have any files whatsoever. I tried changing AccountID in Codex.ini for what I had in my AppData folder. СМОТРЕТЬ КИНО ОНЛАЙН! Сериал: КВЕСТ 2015 1 серия Expand text… глубокий.

So I reached in level 40+ in AC origins CPY crack last year and now I obviously don't want to play the whole game all over and then start playing the DLC. I did work on it more or less --gt I found two saved files (named 1.save amp 2.save of size 205kb amp 207kb) in C:\Users\USER\Documents\CPY\_SAVES\CPY\UPLAY\1803 then copy-pasted them into C:\Users\Public\Documents\uPlay\CODEX\Saves\AssassinsCreedOrigins  But it never occurred to show any progress after launchin.

I bought; Doom, Fallout 4, H1Z1 and Rainbow. i dont want to restart my game a 3rd time ive already played 36 hours and just want to finish. The competition in the US for its opening weekend is more than likely going to keep AC from being a hit, and the marketing has been pretty ho-hum so far as well. What do you think Assassin's Creed is going to make worldwide? Is the marketing outside the US solid? Will overseas save Assassin's Creed. I synchronized all the viewpoints, bought all the weapons, collected all the seals from the tombs, all the codex pages, et cetera, got all the way to the final two or three missions in the game and it randomly crashed and corrupted all my save data. It saved a backup online, but one from a full day ago, in which none of those things were complete. Really pissed, and now don't even want to try to finish. 
The Pops Shipping included on all. Ready to move on from these pops, taking offers on all of them. Have several of them bundled up but have no problem in seperating those. If you buy 3 or more I'm more likely to be able to give an even better deal. Willing to take pretty much any offer that lets me move on from them without losing money, and I got most of them cheap, so don't be afraid to shoot me an offer. Will also happily look at any and all trade offers Since I was one of them, I wonder how much 'drama about DRM' actually affects the end result. Many of my PC gaming friends talked negatively about the DRM in AC2 and gaming in general, but they were not planning to purchase the game anyway. I recently discovered this after doing a clean wipe on my PC and then trying to play Starbound. Starbound doesn't support cloud saves yet, so I had to start fresh. After a little googling I found this how to on doing your own cloud saves. It works with any cloud service. I personally use Google Drive over Dropbox. Hope this helps some people out. I hate starting over! lol source: 2nd to last post on the first page https://steamcommunity.com/app/211820/discussions/0/352788917753465480/ --------. ARTICLE TEXT FOLLOWS : "" It’s been a tumultuous year for Ubisoft. What’s the state of Assassin’s Creed as we close out 2014? Assassin’s Creed took a beating this year. Unity isn’t a bad game, by any means, and in all fairness I think its bugs aren’t significantly worse than, say, Dragon Age: Inquisition, which has received a much more positive reception. But as I’ve already argued, Ubisoft shot itself in the foot with that review embargo nonsense, and Unity now has a poisonous reputati. Hello, I couldn't find the answer anywhere so here it goes. I've got an Assassin's Creed 2 Standard Edition from a computer magazine and I am pretty much halfway through. I've managed to get my hands on a bundle with Assassin's Creed 2 Deluxe Edition (the only difference are 3 Templar Lairs) and successfully activated it on uplay, the problem is I only see the Standard Edition. After contacting Uplay support they've said that this problem occurs with older games and that they can delete I know that the legit version is stored under the "4" folder in the UbisoftGameLauncher, but i pirated the game. Where is it's save location? (cracked by skidrow. Hi, I play my games across multiple machines and have been stupefied by the amount of modern games that Don't support cloud-save on Steam. I got Starbound and thought that it would cloud-save so I can play on the go on my Laptop, at my home office or on my media-pc. However it had no cloud-save. I figured I could create a Symbolic Link in windows to my Dropbox folder on my Home Server to give myself "Cloud Save" in this game. Well it works wonderfully. I've done this for AssCreed Brotherhood. I got this game when it was free on XBL, and I've been playing the shit out of it since. I really got back into the story recently, so I've been doing that instead of miscellaneous stuff. Anyways, I was playing a few days ago and my file corrupted. I can't find the motivation to sit through hours of tutorials and stuff at the beginning, so I was wondering if anyone has a game save I can upload to my account via Horizon. I was on the first hidden gun assassination, but anything close before. So I recently picked up AC2 for , I'm about 1/4 of the way through and loving it so I decided to order the Ezio trilogy (cheaper than getting brotherhood amp revelations separately). 2 Questions: 1. Will my save game be usable if I trade in my AC2 disc and just play from the trilogy pack? 2. Will this affect the trophies I have earned/will they carry over? Thanks in advance. 
I would like ALL or most of the of the games for both Assassins Creed 2 and L4D2. Steam ID: Deathseiryu EDIT: Assassins Creed 2 has been traded. Now trading The Witcher: I got it because it was free and I just finished the part where he gets out of the animus and has to turn on the security systems when my game froze so I turned it off. Now my save file is gone can anybody. I just bought AC 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and started playing 2. After playing at least an hour, I quit and come back, then realize that the goddamn motherfucking game didn't save. I know it's only an hour, but I really don't want to have to do that shit again. Is there any way to get back the save I was playing on, or at the very least, prevent this from happening again? On top of that, the default gamepad controls are nothing like they should be, and the keyboard controls I just bought AC 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, and started playing 2.

Is there any way to get back the save I was playing on, or at the very least, prevent this from happening again? On top of that, the default gamepad controls are nothing like they should be, and the keyboard controls are really. 
So yeah, I found the saves from yesterday on my hard drive in C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\savegames\ randomchars , but there's no way to make UPlay/Assassin's Creed 2 use them instead of the UPlay cloud save, which set me back many hours in the game. Judging by a Google search, a lot of people have had this problem. Is there </p>
