Fall is in full swing, and Thanksgiving is upon us along with all the food comas and other consumption that usually happens. :) This calls for a new podcast! One of our sub regulars /u/marshallbritt is in charge this month, and he's got a few records to share with us. He'll be playing his own music, some from the man himself, and other records by other producers he admires. You'll want to listen to/download this one for yourself.hope you all enjoy!! ---------- STREAM/DOWNLOAD. 
Background Music has been a significant part of all my life, and I've been surrounded by different influences of different genres, mainly by my parent's tastes. My mom introduced me to: Led Zeppelin, Cat Stevens, The Beatles, Neil Young, whatever music you could dance to or that spoke about any form of love; then my dad's inheritance was to learn to appreciate intricate passages and long compositions: Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, while not forgetting about the heavy stuff: Black Sabbath, Metall. I just recorded this backing track with my PO-20. It's an arrangement of "Everything counts" by Depeche Mode. I only own a PO-20, therefore it is very uncomfortable to play a live lead melody. I think it would be nice to collaborate on it to produce a complete result: someone who owns a PO-28 or a PO-16 (or someone who sings nicely) could record the lead melody -- with backing vocals -- over my backing track. If you like the idea, you can download the track here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7.

Sassan I've run out of space, so refer to the link above. Hi guys! Just like in the title, I'm looking for a male vocalist, preferably with a nice deep voice and good range, for an 80's style synthpop song. Inspired by bands like aha, Spandau Ballet, Depeche Mode etc. Here's a raw demo for your reference, with minimal mixing. https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0wb8fiay7l5ibq/beautifulnightmare%20vox%20demo%201.mp3?dl=0 Original key: D minor, but can be adjusted to suit your vocals Lyrics https://www.dropbox.com/s/s82vlilkz6qgk6f/Beautiful%20Nightmare%20lyrics.

Arthur Russell seems mythical -- except everything you've read about him is bound to be true. He did join a Buddhist hippy commune after running away from his farm town in Iowa. He did learn beat poetry under the tutelage of Allen Ginsburg. Coverville: The Cover Music Show! Please leave your thoughts or links pertaining to this episode.
